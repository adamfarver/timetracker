# Time Tracker App

Full-stack app designed for multiple users to track time spent on projects. I've intentionally left the auth system disabled so people can view the working software. Deployment will reset via node-cron job every 15 minutes.

## Back-End API

- MongoDB Atlas
- NodeJS
- Express
- Mongoose

## Front-End

- GraphJS
- RXJS
